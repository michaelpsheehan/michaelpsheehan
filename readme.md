# I'm Michael

I'm a Software Engineer with a front-end focus, I specialize in React, Typescript, Redux, React Hooks and the Context API but I work across all parts of a Serverless, microservice stack. When working on the backend I like to use AWS, Lambdas, API Gateway, Dynamo DB, CloudFormation, CloudFront, Cognito and CloudWatch. 

I’m a big fan of the JAM Stack, my portfolio is built with React, Gatsby, Tailwind, Three.JS, GSAP 3, and Lottie-Web, all powered by Craft CMS running on a Digital Ocean, Linux Server using NGINX. 

I love to push boundaries and work with new technologies like Three.js, WebGL, page transitions and SVG animations.
